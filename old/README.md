There are not actively used, just get them out of the way. I'm not a fan of "guess if something existed previously, maybe I used awesomevm & tint2 10 years ago?" - searching optimistically in `git log` is not my favorite pastime. It's easier to just check this directory for traces.

Use `git log --follow` to see historical changes to these files.
